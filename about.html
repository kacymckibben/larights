				<p>“Ms. Kuwahara has been extremely informative and helpful throughout our legal process.” <i>- Amie S.</i></p><br>
				<p>"Ms. Deniece Kuwahara has been a genuine dedicated and bright council to me. She has worked on couple of my cases and advised me on many others occasions. As an immigrant, she has been a strong actor in my life for the last 2 years. She is very good at her job and very caring. Her availability and flexibility were unprecedented and the results were there. With her, I was able to understand the process and it was important to me. After all the time I have spent with her, I will say that I have no doubt she is a gentile, dedicate human being who passionately care about immigrants and everybody's human rights. She has volunteered her time to many good causes and inspired me. Without hesitation, I would recommend her and her services." <i>- Patrick</i></p><br>
				<p>“As many immigrants, lacking the resources to afford a private attorney, I let a public notary to handle my case, what seemed to be a cheap situation ended up being a terrible decision. After meeting several attorneys, - most not willing to take my case and others willing to take it at an exuberant cost, - I was so fortunate in finding Ms. Kuwahara.<br><br>Ms. Kuwahara’s services are very affordable and her interest in helping the immigrant community is without precedent. After assessing my case and explaining the process in simple terms, I decided to let her handle my already complicated case.  She kept me informed at every stage of the process and thanks to her hard work now I enjoy legal staying in this country. I remain so thankful for her help.  Ms. Kuwahara’s compassion for the immigrant community is impressive.  Ms. Kuwahara is a strong fighter for human rights and advocates for the less fortunate. Her interaction with the immigrant community has given her the understanding of the legal difficulties it faces on a daily basis in this country.<br><br>Without hesitation I recommend Ms. Kuwahara’s services to family members, friends and to everyone in need of an excellent representation on immigration matters.” <i>- Levi S.</i></p>
