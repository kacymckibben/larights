	      			<h2>Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)</h2>
	      			<p>Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) is a program initiated by the Obama administration that allows certain undocumented individuals to stay in the United States without being removed.</p>
	      			<p>Eligibility requirements for deferred action:</p>
	      			<ul>
	      				<li>Were under the age of 31 as of June 15, 2012</li>
	      				<li>Came to the United States before reaching your 16th birthday</li>
	      				<li>Have continuously resided in the United States since June 15, 2007, up to the present time</li>
	      				<li>Were physically present in the United States on June 15, 2012, and at the time of making your request for consideration of deferred action with USCIS</li>
	      				<li>Entered without inspection before June 15, 2012, or your lawful immigration status expired as of June 15, 2012</li>
	      				<li>Are currently in school, have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school, have obtained a general education development (GED) certificate, or are an honorably discharged veteran of the Coast Guard or Armed Forces of the United States</li>
	      				<li>Have not been convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor, three or more other misdemeanors, and do not otherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety</li>
	      			</ul>
	      			<p>Benefits of deferred action:</p>
	      			<ul>
	      				<li>Work permit</li>
	      				<li>Limits on deportation</li>
	      			</ul>
	      			<p><i>Note that deferred action will not give you a legal permanent residency status (a greencard) and is not a pathway to citizenship.</i></p>
	      			<h4 class="sub-title">Expanded DACA</h4>
	      			<p>The expanded DACA program is currently on hold. The program, when it becomes available, will include individuals who arrived in the United States before the age of 16 without an age cap, have resided continuously in the United States starting in January 1, 2010 and expands the work authorization period to 3 years.</p>
	      			<p>Risks of deferred action:</p>
	      			<p>Deferred action is not for everybody, for example, any criminal history could put you at risk.  In addition, deferred action is a temporary program. Consult an attorney today to weigh the benefits and risks associated with obtaining deferred action.</p>

				<div class="row review">
					<p>"Ms. Deniece Kuwahara has been a genuine dedicated and bright council to me. She has worked on couple of my cases and advised me on many others occasions. As an immigrant, she has been a strong actor in my life for the last 2 years. She is very good at her job and very caring. <span class="content">Her availability and flexibility were unprecedented and the results were there. With her, I was able to understand the process and it was important to me. After all the time I have spent with her, I will say that I have no doubt she is a gentile, dedicate human being who passionately care about immigrants and everybody's human rights. She has volunteered her time to many good causes and inspired me. Without hesitation, I would recommend her and her services."</span><a class="more-btn" href="">Read more...</a></p>

				<div class="row review">
					<p>“As many immigrants, lacking the resources to afford a private attorney, I let a public notary to handle my case, what seemed to be a cheap situation ended up being a terrible decision. After meeting several attorneys, - most not willing to take my case and others willing to take it at an exuberant cost, - I was so fortunate in finding Ms. Kuwahara. 
					<span class="content">Ms. Kuwahara’s services are very affordable and her interest in helping the immigrant community is without precedent. After assessing my case and explaining the process in simple terms, I decided to let her handle my already complicated case.  She kept me informed at every stage of the process and thanks to her hard work now I enjoy legal staying in this country. I remain so thankful for her help.  Ms. Kuwahara’s compassion for the immigrant community is impressive.  Ms. Kuwahara is a strong fighter for human rights and advocates for the less fortunate. Her interaction with the immigrant community has given her the understanding of the legal difficulties it faces on a daily basis in this country.<br><br>Without hesitation I recommend Ms. Kuwahara’s services to family members, friends and to everyone in need of an excellent representation on immigration matters.”</span><a class="more-btn" href="">Read more...</a></p>
